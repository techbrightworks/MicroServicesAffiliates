MicroservicesSimpleDiscovery
-----------------------------
1.From the command Line move to each of the Folder  and build the each Project.
2.Build Command: mvn clean install eclipse:clean eclipse:eclipse -Dwtpversion=2.0
3.Most common way to Run each of the Project with mvn spring-boot:run , the current application.yml in all the projects is provided for this run.
4:Now it is time to check the urls:
ServiceDiscovery:http://localhost:1111/    ---> Here check both the below application are registered
SpringBootRestClient:http://localhost:3333/call/optimal?pence=576
SpringBootRestService:http://localhost:2222/change/optimal?pence=576

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now you are still inquisitive and want to run all three applications on Tomcat: 
1.Suppose say you want to run  each of the project with Tomcat using tomcat7-maven-plugin with command mvn tomcat7:run-war.
then these simple changes below would help
In the application.yml of ServiceDiscovery change the hostname to localhost/ServiceDiscovery
In the application.yml of SpringBootRestService and SpringBootRestService  change the Discovery Server Access as below
# Discovery Server Access
eureka:
    client:
      serviceUrl:
        defaultZone: http://localhost:1111/ServiceDiscovery/eureka/
Also have to add "/SpringBootRestService" to the exisiting 	path provided in the ChangeClientServiceImpl of SpringBootRestClient.	
2.Then urls to check would be:
ServiceDiscovery:http://localhost:1111/ServiceDiscovery/
SpringBootRestClient:http://localhost:3333/SpringBootRestClient/call/optimal?pence=357
SpringBootRestService:http://localhost:2222/SpringBootRestService/change/optimal?pence=576
